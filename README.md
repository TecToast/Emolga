# Emolga

Emolga is a discord bot based on the [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) library, which is mainly focused on Pokémon.
The main feature is the analysis of Pokémon Showdown! replays.
It has also lots of features helping to manage a draft league, like hosting a draft with a timer, automatic insertion of
picked mons into a google sheet and a lot more, which are currently used in a few draft leagues and will be made public
available someday in the future.

The main language of the bot is German (because me and the main users are German), full english support is planned.

The bot also has a [website](https://emolga.tectoast.de) (source code [here](https://github.com/TecToast/emolgaweb)).

Contributions are welcome, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
For contact, you can join [Emolga's discord server](https://discord.gg/WYfKHPCgs9) or contact me directly on discord
(`@tectoast`).
